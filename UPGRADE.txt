Upgrading from the Drupal module
---------------------------------------
Right now there is no automated upgrade process. Here are the steps to to this manually.

1) Before disabling the Drupal module make a note of your current settings by visiting:
http://yoursite.org/admin/config/civicrm_cdntaxreceipts/settings

You may want to copy the settings into a text file. Make a note of which files you are using for your logo, signature
etc. and download a local copy so that you can re-upload them for use with the extension.
If anything is wrong with your module install you can also find these settings in the drupal database variables table
using "SELECT * FROM variable WHERE name LIKE 'cdntax%'" (If you use a prefix for your Drupal tables modify the table
name variable to suit).

2) Migrate the issued tax receipts information from the module's tables:
Access your site's database. For example on your web host you will be able to use phpMyAdmin. Select the two tables
called
* With selected -> export
* Choose custom
* Choose data only (this will mean it contains only INSERT statements)
Edit the exported file:
* Enter this line at the top: "SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS = 0;"
* Find and replace all: (Adjust if your database uses a prefix)
civicrm_cdntaxreceipts_log => cdntaxreceipts_log
civicrm_cdntaxreceipts_log_contributions => cdntaxreceipts_log_contributions

3) Activate the extension. See https://wiki.civicrm.org/confluence/display/CRMDOC/Extensions for more information.

4) Enter the settings you saved into the extension by visiting http://yoursite.org/civicrm/cdntaxreceipts/settings?reset=1

5) Import the edited SQL data file to your civicrm database.

6) Check that you have successfully imported your receipts by visiting the Receipts Issued Report.

7) Clean up your Drupal database: After disabling the drupal module you can optionally clean up the module's variables
since it does not do this automatically. In your Drupal database:
DELETE FROM variable WHERE name LIKE 'cdntax%'
