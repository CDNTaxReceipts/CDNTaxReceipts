Upgrading from the Drupal module
---------------------------------------
Right now there is no automated upgrade process. Here are the steps to to this manually.

1) Before disabling the Drupal module make a note of your current settings by visiting:
http://yoursite.org/admin/config/civicrm_cdntaxreceipts/settings

You may want to copy the settings into a text file. Make a note of which files you are using for your logo, signature
etc. and download a local copy so that you can re-upload them for use with the extension.
If anything is wrong with your module install you can also find these settings in the drupal database variables table
using "SELECT * FROM variable WHERE name LIKE 'cdntax%'" (If you use a prefix for your Drupal tables modify the table
name variable to suit).

2) Migrate the issued tax receipts information from the module's tables:
Access your site's database. For example on your web host you may be able to use phpMyAdmin. Alternatively you may have ssh access and permissions to
access your database via the command line: mysql -h localhost -u myadminuser -p (where myadminuser is a mysql user with
privileges to access your database).

Instructions for phpMyAdmin:

Export 
Export Method: Custom
Table(s) select:
civicrm_cdntaxreceipts_log
civicrm_cdntaxreceipts_log_contributions
Output: Save output to file
Format-specific options: data
Go
Save file

Edit the exported file with a text editor:
* Enter this line at the top: SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS = 0;
* Find and replace all: (Adjust if your database uses a prefix)
civicrm_cdntaxreceipts_log => cdntaxreceipts_log

Instructions for command line access:
mysqldump -p --user=username  dbname civicrm_cdntaxreceipts_log >civicrm_cdntaxreceipts_log.sql
mysqldump -p --user=username  dbname civicrm_cdntaxreceipts_log_contributions >civicrm_cdntaxreceipts_log_contributions.sql

3) Activate the extension. So the README.md file - and also see https://wiki.civicrm.org/confluence/display/CRMDOC/Extensions for more information
on extensions in general.

4) Enter the settings you saved into the extension by visiting http://yoursite.org/civicrm/cdntaxreceipts/settings?reset=1

5) Import the edited SQL data file to your civicrm database. 

Instructions for phpMyAdmin:
Import
File to import: the .sql file you created in step 2). 
Go

Instructions for command line access:
mysql -u username -p -D dbname < civicrm_cdntaxreceipts_log.sql
mysql -u username -p -D dbname < civicrm_cdntaxreceipts_log_contributions.sql

6) Check that you have successfully imported your receipts by visiting the Receipts Issued Report: 
CiviCRM -> Reports -> create new report from template - Tax Receipts - Receipts issued

7) Clean up your Drupal database: After disabling the drupal module you can optionally clean up the module's variables
since it does not do this automatically. In your Drupal database:
DELETE FROM variable WHERE name LIKE 'cdntax%'

8) Clean up the settings.php - these bits are no longer needed:
# 'civicrm_contact' => 'local_civicrm743x.',
# 'civicrm_contribution' => 'local_civicrm743x.',
# 'civicrm_contribution_type' => 'local_civicrm743x.',
